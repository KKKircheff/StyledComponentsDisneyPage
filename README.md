# Recrating Disney landing page with Styled Components library and React Router integration
- React
- React Router
- Styled components library for styling

Simple single page app with implemented React router and styled with 'Styled-components' library.

Issues covered:

1. As styled components failed to install with simple 'npm i styled-components', solution:
- npm install styled-components@latest

2. Applying background image from the local machine with styled components and realative path - solution:
- import bgrImage from '../assets/background.jpg'; /* importing the image in the react component */
- background-image: url(${bgrImage}); /* implementation in the style section */
